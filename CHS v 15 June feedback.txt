15 June notes:

why is biofuel and chemical agent in Improvised Armor ? : )

crossbow perk includes gunHuntingRifleScoped at level 1?  : )

animal traps perk seems a little expensive (8 points vs. chemistry which is only 7 points, lockpicks which is 10 or improvised armor which is 5 / level)

clubs need to be locked with perk, low cost - everyone gets basic, 5 points for each improvement?

cooking quest - did you use "fetch" or "fetch keep"?  May be reason it completes early

loot stuff:
	container 42 - check % - I only get .91 total and lots of gun duplicates -guns are good, but . . . 0.3+0.275+0.2+0.075+0.075+0.075 = 1
	assorted seeds vs. animal feed (with recipe to turn assorted seeds into animal feed) - just "feels" better, someone may actually want to plant some seeds and come back later most will not have animal traps or need them (unless you tweak food to require more hunting / farming - Medieval? ? ?)

Starting Gear - lower quality clothes?  Allows player to "upgrade" as they find loot; bare minimum (gun, ammo, clothes, possibly a class specific item or two, food?, water?, bandage? - food / water is plentiful, zombie loot and POI, corn, potato, yucca)

energy drink - need recipe (use coffee beans?); add stamina recovery over time buff

Lokiwater recipe - murky in the quest, still clean in the recipe - make it just "purified" so it stacks; perhaps for CHS use the clean water - no one is dying of thirst as in Vanilla

cooking - change "boiled corn" to roasted corn - use grill

Cold drink versions - can we have recipe to make them "not cold" (stacking) some fridges not working to cool beverages (shiny metal "top" in ranger POI)

check damage (base) for all guns, bows and crossbow

recipes with glue (less glue - a whole bottle goes a long way : )

grain alcohol is not used for much - no medical? but a loot on nurses (replace with Cider? Blueberry Mead? Take out Beer and Grain Alcohol and add both Cider / Blueberry : )

Healing stuff
	add more options for each tier - healing bandage and first aid kits
		(watch redundancy - healing agent, + pain med)
		replace alcohol with H2O2 for nurse loot / med cabinet?
	tier 2 - bandage + alcohol; bandage + aloe; bandage + h2o2; healing agent
	tier 3 - any tier 2 bandage + pain med + sewing kit (+duct tape); antibiotics (if they still work ? - later implementation ? )

ammo crafting - still need bullet tumbler in workstation, but can craft in backpack - however, no way to convert casings?  (I think with the new ammo cases, just remove ammo crafting - use what you have got - unless you find a forge house and have calipers)

check tool drops - since we can't craft them, they might be a less rare drop
	(all POI's, only certain containers, certain zombies - no just snow biome)

survival stove - could it require a "fuel log" to craft vs. pot and grill?  (Sterno?)
	of course once "destroyed" it would lose any fuel timer (but fuel logs last a long time)
	pot craft from scrap (vs. just a tin can?)
	grill craft from scrap (vs. 5/7/8 iron pipes?)

cooking - change "boiled corn" to roasted corn - use grill

cull quests / maps - only those that "fit"?  (too many useless - nail some chicks, drunk and disorderly, etc. - check and see if any play tester actually goes to the trouble of finding "treasure")

Supply Crates:
	no first aid kits (make people get the perk : ) - replace with aloe or H2O2 so they can make tier 2
	ammo specials (extra damage from HP,slug. siege - do these matter in CHS)
	What if supply weapons "always" had a mod? - makes them rare / special
	actual power tool might be nice - even if it is just the parts (all) - BUT CRAFTING? - chainsaw, auger, nailgun - fun but probably not needed
	weed cleaver - does it have a use in CHS?  (more base building) - a hunting knife, skinning knife or butcher knife would be more useful
	tools - steel only?  (makes it worth keeping)
	"weapon" tools - sledge hammer, sycthe, claw hammer (pickaxe?, fireaxe?)
	non weapon tools - wrench, shovel, hoe (not needed?)
